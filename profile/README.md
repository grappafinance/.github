  Grappa is a grape-based pomace brandy originally made to prevent waste by using leftovers. We believe there are lots of waste in capital when it comes to DeFi options, and we are here to change that.

## Introduction

Grappa is a project dedicated to build open, permissionless infrastructure to help bootstrap the DeFi option space.

We believe that the core values of DeFi are composability and decentralization. The current DeFi option space is suffering a lot from liquidity segmentation because no one has built a trust-worthy base layer that everyone feels comfortable building on top of.

Grappa is here to be that base layer that meets different needs, and also provides an efficient exchange layer (aggregator) for people to easily exchange options across products.

## Funding

The project is 100% open sourced and publicly funded on [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/7713/grappa-finance).

## What exactly are we building?

Grappa is mainly composed of 2 parts:

#### 1. Core: Decentralized margin & settlement layer for options and spreads

The base layer is a decentralized derivative token that can be created by different **margin engine**. Users with different risk tolerance can choose among different engines based on gas cost, capital efficiency and risk of liquidation.

We also natively support call spread and put spread that can increase capital efficiency by a lot while being fully collateralized.

For more information, please go to [core repo](https://github.com/grappafinance/core).

#### 2. Exchange Layer

We are building an exchange layer between the same kind of option token created by different margin engines. For example: AMM to exchange between fully collateralized and partially collateralized options.
